## Key Learnings
SetTimeOut Method - This help to regulate when things execute. With this method, we can tell our code when to execute.

Math.floor() and Math.random() method - This methods enabled the App to generate random whole numbers for looping and selections.

Incorporating the Dark and Light Mode.

Incorporating the 1-click to copy feature - This feature enable users to click to copy their preffered password option to the clipboard which they can then save for future use.

Manipulating the DOM.

Responsive Layout - Mobile First
Media Query.

Discovered that multiple event listeners can be added to a single element - This enabled me to incorporate screentip/screenhint feature - A feature that I love so much(for only desktop users).
